**My name is :** Jenny Gangheena Kim. 

**I am from :** Seoul, South Korea. 

**I love :** learning new languages and getting to know about different cultures around the world. 

**I majored in :**
English Literature & Culture AND Spanish Studies AT Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (Seoul, Korea)

**I lived in :** Malaysia, Singapore and Canada (during my school years), and also in Spain and Mexico (as an exchange student in 2018-2019).
